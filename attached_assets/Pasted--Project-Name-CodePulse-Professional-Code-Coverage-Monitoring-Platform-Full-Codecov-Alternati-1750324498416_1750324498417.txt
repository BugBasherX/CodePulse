⚙️ Agent Instructions
Replit AI Agent must:

Build a fully functional backend in FastAPI with RESTful API and GitHub PR integrations.

Build a responsive frontend in React (or Next.js if multi-page).

Build a CLI uploader (binary or script).

Set up auth (OAuth2), DB (PostgreSQL), and file storage (S3 or Replit FS).

Parse and normalize multiple coverage formats.

Build GitHub App stub (simulated if GitHub SDK not available).

Integrate tests and CI/CD sample files.

Finalize with documentation, test data, demo scripts.

✅ Deliverables:
Complete web app (frontend + backend)

Fully working uploader CLI

Live coverage visualizations

GitHub PR comment handler

CI integration examples

OAuth login and team support

Deployment-ready Docker setup

Clean and documented codebase

🤖 Deployment Environment (Optional):
Localhost or Replit preview

Deployable to Vercel (frontend) + Render/Fly.io (backend)

Use .env or Replit Secrets

🔚 Final Notes:
This is an advanced full-stack SaaS-style coverage platform, built to function as a true alternative to Codecov. The agent must generate all components, wire them together, and test them, with full local development setup.

DO NOT stop at a basic version. Build a production-grade app.
